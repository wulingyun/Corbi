\title{network querying method based on conditional random fields}

\description{
Find the best matching subnetworks from a large target network for small querying networks based on the conditional random fields (CRFs) model. }

\usage{
net.query <- function(query.net, target.net, node.sim, query.type=2, ...)
net.query <- function(query.net, target.net, node.sim, query.type=2, delta.d=1e-10, delta.c=0.5, delta.e=1, delta.s=1, output="result.txt")
}

\arguments{
\item{query.net}{The file name of the querying network.}

\item{target.net}{The file name of the target network. }

\item{node.sim}{The file name of the node similarity scores between the querying network and the target network.}

\item{query.type}{The querying network type.}

\item{delta.d}{The parameter delta.d is a parameter for deletions.}

\item{delta.c}{The parameter delta.c is  a parameter for consecutive deletions.}

\item{delta.e}{The parameter delta.e is a parameter for single deletion.}

\item{delta.s}{The parameter delta.s is a parameter for insertions.}

\item{output}{The output files' name.}
}

\details{
This is an approach for network querying problem based on conditional random field (CRF) model which can handle both undirected and directed networks, acyclic and cyclic networks, and any number of insertions/deletions.

\itemize{
\item query.net: The querying file is written as follows:\cr
v1 v2 \cr
v3 v4 \cr
...   \cr
where v1,v2,v3,v4, ... are the nodes' names and each line contains an edge in the network.

\item target.net: The format of this file is the same as the querying network file.

\item node.sim: This files' format is as follows:\cr
v1 V1 s1 \cr
v1 V2 s2 \cr
...      \cr
v1 is the node from the querying network, 
V1 is the node from the target network, 
s1 is the similarity score between the node v1 and V1, and so on.

\item query.type: If the querying is a chain, we set qtype=0; If the querying is a tree, we set qtype=1; If the querying is a graph with loops, we set qtype=2; with the default is 2.

\item delta.d:  The smaller delta.d is, the heavier penalty for deletions. 

\item delta.c: The smaller delta.c is, the heavier penalty for consecutive deletions.

\item delta.e: The smaller delta.e is, the heavier penalty for single deletion.

\item delta.s: The larger delta.s indicates heavier penalty for insertions.
